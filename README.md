# what-up-china
A simple website that allows you to see what's going on in the Chinese web. 

## Problem
The Chinese internet is a black box to everyone who lives outside of China. The news and information we get about China is usually filtered through an intermediary who may or may not have a selective bias. Even though the Chinese internet is technically accessible to outsiders, the process of discovery is very difficult. 

## How this website hopes to solve this issue
This website hopes to make the discovery process for what's trending on the Chinese web super easy by collecting and curating the trends on the Chinese web to a simple webpage, that can be translated by machine to the reader's language.
